Red-black tree

My implementation of Red-black tree library:
1) All functions are tested
2) O(log(n)) tree high
3) Beautiful visualization
4) Loop searches 

You can test all things in this lib via:
1) 'make test' - binary + run all unittests
2) 'make cov_tree' - all unittests + coverage
3) 'make name.png' - run dot to make png from tree (name you can find in folder or your .dot file from 'tree_dump'
